# How AFROTC Can Leverage GitHub
### **Maj Daniel McKeown, Det 345, UMass-Lowell**

---
## The Problem
- Mistakes happen because a wrong document is used or the document is out of date
- How much time have you wasted waiting on others to complete their review of a document and submit their recommended changes?
	- Using a comment matrix
- Then when you get the document back you see this...interesting naming convention:
>`document_2021_08_21_clean_fixed_revised_final_final-version2`

---
## A Solution
[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based interface that uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time.

Replace "web pages" with "documents" and you begin to see how GitHub can help AFROTC publish policy, guides, and other documents to the field faster and with a more collaborative approach.

## Terms and Definitions
Repository (repo) — a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.

Branch — a workspace in which you can make changes that won’t affect the live site.

Markdown (.md) — a way to write in Github that converts plain text to GitHub code. Sites such as Atom and Sublime Text are examples of free resources for developers using Markdown.

Commit Changes — a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo.

Pull Request (PR) — the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done.

Merge — after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site

Issues — how work is tracked when using git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.
